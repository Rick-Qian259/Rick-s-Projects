You are a software developer in an Emergency Service Center. Your team is building a system to help emergency call takers to organise ambulances for patients. Your team has designed and implemented part of the system.

In this system, it will record the Name, Phone Number, Triage Level (a number indicates how serious the patient's condition, from 1 to 5) and Location for each patient. When one patient call Emergency Service Center, this system will assign a unique id to this patient.

To make sure patients with higher triage level can be sent to the emergency department first, the waiting list will always give patients with higher triage level a higher priority. For patients has the same triage level, the patient who comes earlier should be assigned an ambulance first.
